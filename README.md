# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-with-3D-and-Bilinear-CNN-Model

In this paper, we look into the problem of hand gesture recognition which is becoming important in the au- tomotive user interface. Hence, a bilinear 3D CNN model is developed, using RGB and depth data. The spatio-temporal data augmentation is employed to reduce over-fitting and improve model generalization. To further test the bilinear 3D CNN model, we compare its performance with the performance of 3D CNN architecture, without the bilinear classifier, on VIVA challenge dataset. The bilinear 3D CNN model achieves 72.0% classification accuracy.

project_1.py is the original 3D CNN model with data argumentation and 8-fold cross-validation.
project_2.py is the new 3D CNN model with Bilinear vector and data argumentation, 8-fold cross-validation.
